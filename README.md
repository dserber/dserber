## Hi there, I'm David Serber ðŸ‘‹
Lately I've loved learning the latest web development technology innovations such as Next.js, Astro, Typescript, and Tailwind. SSG and SSR along with MDX is such an interesting emerging tech combination. I really like how developers can choose to be more responsible with the amount of javascript shipped to the client. 

Also, I'm particularly interested in how Flutter as a cross platform mobile development continues to evolve. 

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in web and/or mobile development, ideally developing in React and/or Flutter. I'd especially love working at a startup or small company since I really like working in small teams where I can participate in all stages of development and make an impact quickly. If you're hiring for full-time, contract, freelance, or just want some advice about tech, let's chat!
