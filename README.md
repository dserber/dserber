## Hi there, I'm David Serber ðŸ‘‹
I've loved learning the latest web development innovations such as Next.js, Astro, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. I think SSG and SSR along paired with markdown is such an interesting tech combo! I really like how developers can choose to be more responsible with the amount of javascript shipped to the client. 

Also, I'm particularly interested in how Flutter evolves in the cross platform app development space. 

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in web and/or mobile development, ideally developing in React and/or Flutter. I'd especially love working at a startup since I really like working in small teams where I can participate in all stages of development and make an impact quickly. 

If you're hiring for full-time, contract, freelance, or just want some advice about tech, let's chat!

- Feel free to check out my [portfolio] (https://www.davidwserber.com/) website!
- I build with: `React (Nextjs)`, `Typescript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Flutter`, `Firebase`...
- I'm currently learning `Astro`
- I'm passionate about developer productivity, clean & readable code, and team communication
- I enjoy learning about minimalism, reading, traveling to Mexico (I'm fluent in Spanish), lifting weights
